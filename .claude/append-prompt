# ORCHESTRATION INFRASTRUCTURE AWARENESS

This project has sophisticated orchestration infrastructure available. Below is guidance (not mandate) for optimal task execution.

---

## Legal-Braniac Orchestrator

**Purpose:** Meta-coordinator for complex, multi-domain tasks requiring decomposition and delegation.

**When to consider:**
- Complex tasks with 3+ distinct steps
- Multi-domain problems (legal + technical + data)
- Architectural decisions requiring multiple specialized perspectives
- Tasks explicitly requesting "planning" or "orchestration"

**Invocation:**
```
Task tool with subagent_type='legal-braniac'
```

**Capabilities:**
- Task decomposition into atomic subtasks
- Agent delegation with dependency tracking
- Parallel execution coordination
- Quality validation across deliverables

**Note:** Use judgment - simple tasks don't need orchestration overhead.

## Specialized Agents (7 Available)

The following agents are available for delegation when their expertise matches task requirements:

- **planejamento-legal** - Architecture and system design for legal automation
- **desenvolvimento** - Hands-on implementation, coding, TDD, refactoring
- **qualidade-codigo** - Code review, testing, security audits, debugging
- **documentacao** - Technical documentation, guides, onboarding materials
- **analise-dados-legal** - Data analysis, metrics, legal publication insights
- **legal-articles-finder** - Legal reference extraction (CF, CC, CPC, CPP, CP, CLT, CDC, ECA, CTN)
- **legal-text-extractor** - Document text extraction and parsing

**When agents add value:**
- Specialized domain knowledge needed (legal analysis, data viz, security)
- Task requires sustained focus in single area (e.g., extended coding session)
- Parallel work beneficial (agent A codes while agent B reviews)

**When to work directly:**
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- Quick edits or searches
- Tasks you're already mid-execution on

## Skills System (35 Available)

Skills provide standardized workflows for specific task types. They auto-detect based on your prompt.

**How it works:**
1. Your prompt is analyzed against skill-rules.json (keywords + intent patterns)
2. Top 5 relevant skills are suggested via systemMessage
3. You see: `🎯 SKILLS DETECTADAS: - feature-planning (critical) - code-auditor (high) ...`
4. Consider using suggested skills for consistent, quality execution

**Skill categories:**
- Planning: feature-planning, writing-plans, executing-plans
- Development: test-driven-development, code-execution, code-refactor
- Quality: code-auditor, systematic-debugging, test-fixing
- Documentation: technical-doc-creator, codebase-documenter, flowchart-creator
- Git: git-pushing, review-implementing
- Content: pdf, docx, xlsx, article-extractor

**When skill suggestion appears:**
- **Prioritize using it** - skills contain vetted workflows and best practices
- If multiple skills suggested, choose most specific to task
- If uncertain which skill, ask user or check skills/ directory

**When to skip skills:**
- Skill suggestion doesn't match task context
- You're in middle of alternative approach that's working
- Task is trivial and skill adds overhead

## Workflow Preference (Guidance)

### For Complex Multi-Step Tasks:
```
1. Consider: Does this need legal-braniac orchestration?
2. If yes: Invoke legal-braniac → automatic agent delegation
3. If no: Check if specialized agent fits → delegate if beneficial
4. Execute: Use suggested skills when they appear
```

### For Standard Tasks:
```
1. Check systemMessage for skill suggestions
2. If skill fits → use it
3. If no skill suggested or doesn't fit → proceed normally
```

### For Quick Operations:
```
Proceed directly - orchestration/delegation has overhead
```

## Key Principles

1. **This is guidance, not mandate** - use judgment based on task complexity
2. **Skills are proactive** - when suggested, they've been pattern-matched to your task
3. **Agents are specialized** - delegation makes sense when expertise aligns
4. **Orchestration is for complexity** - don't over-engineer simple tasks
5. **Quality over speed** - skills/agents provide consistency and best practices
